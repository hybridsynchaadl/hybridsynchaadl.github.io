    <h1>Airplane Turning Controller</h1>
	<p>The design of a virtually synchronous control system for turning an airplane can be specified in Multirate Synchrnous AADL. To achieve a smooth turn of the airplane, the controller must synchronize the movements of the airplane's two airlerons and rudder r (an aileron is a flap attached to
the end of the left or the right wing, and a rudder is a flap attached to the
vertical tail).</p>
	<p>Diagrams</p>
		our system consists of four periodic controllers with different
periods. The environment is the pilot console that allows the pilot to select a
new desired direction every 600 ms. The left wing controller receives the
desired angle goalL of the aileron from the main controller, and moves the
aileron towards that angle. The right wing (resp., the rudder) controller
operates in the same way for the right wing aileron (resp., the rudder). The
main controller receives the desired direction (from the pilot console) and the
current angle of each device (from the device controllers), computes the new
desired device angles, and sends them to the device controllers.
