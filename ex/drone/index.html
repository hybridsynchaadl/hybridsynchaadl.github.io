    <h1>Distributed Drones with Consensus Algorithm</h1>
<p>Virtually synchronous CPSs for controlling distributed drones can be modeled
and analyzed using HybridSYNCHAADL. Controllers of multiple drones collaborate
to achieve common maneuver goals, such as rendezvous. The controllers are
physically distributed, since a controller is included in the hardware of each
drone. Our models take into account continuous dynamics, asynchronous
communication, network delays, clock skews, execution times, sampling and
actuating time, etc.</p>
	<h2>Architecture of Distributed Drones</h2>
<p>

	<p>There are four drone components. Each drone is connected with two other
drones to exchange positions. For example, Drone 1 sends its position to Drone
2, and receives the position of Drone 4. A drone component consists of an
environment and its controller. An environment component specifies the physical
model of the drone, including position and velocity. A controller component
interacts with the environment according to the sampling and actuating times.
All controllers in the model have the same period.</p>
	<h2>AADL Code of Distributed Drones</h2> 
<p>The following AADL component declares the top-level
“implementation” of the system in terms of connections and subcomponents:</p>

<p>
Each drone sends its position through its output ports oX and oY, and receives
the position of the other drone through its input ports iX and iY. The
component is declared to be synchronous with period 100 ms. Also, to meet the
constraints of HybridSynchAADL, the connections between drone components are
delayed and the output ports have some initial values. The maximal clock skew
is given by Hybrid_SynchAADL::Max_Clock_Deviation.
