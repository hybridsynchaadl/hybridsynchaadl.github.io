    <h1>HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL</h1>
	<p>This web page contains artifacts for our paper “HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL” by J. Lee, S. Kim, K. Bae, P. C. Ölveczky, and M. Kang.</p>
	<h2>Download artifact.zip</h2>
			To run the HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments, download the artifact.zip in this <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cpsuef5h">link</a>.
	<h2>How to run artifact in the VM</h2>
		<p>
			Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.
            There is set-up.sh script which downloads the JDK8 and GNU parallel
			automatically. The script is assumed to be executed in the Ubuntu
            environment so that it downloads the software using apt (Advanced Package Tool).
		</p>
	<h2>How to run artifact in the non VM</h2>
		<p>
			Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your Desktop directory. 
			To run the HybridSynchAADL tool, it needs JDK8. Refer to the
			following web site: 'https://openjdk.java.net/install/'. The script
            'run_expr' performs an analysis using GNU parallel. To execute the script,
            download GNU parallel using your package installer or refer to the following
            website 'https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/'
