    <h1>HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL</h1>
	<p>This web page contains artifacts for our paper “HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL” by J. Lee, S. Kim, K. Bae, P. C. Ölveczky, and M. Kang.</p>
	<h2>Download artifact.zip</h2>
			To run the HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments, download the <a href="https://hybridsynchaadl.github.io/artifact_cav2021/artifact/artifact.zip">artifact.zip</a>.
	<h2>How to run artifact in the VM</h2>
		<p>
			Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.
            There is set-up.sh script which downloads the JDK8 and GNU parallel
			automatically. The script is assumed to be executed in Ubuntu
            environment so that it download the software using apt (Advanced Package Tool).

	<h2>How to run artifact in the non VM</h2>
		<p>
			Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your Desktop directory. 
			To run the HybridSynchAADL, it needs to download JDK8. Refer to the
			following web site: 'https://openjdk.java.net/install/'. The script
            'run_expr' performs an analysis using GNU parallel. To execute the script,
            download GNU parallel using your package installer or refer to the following
