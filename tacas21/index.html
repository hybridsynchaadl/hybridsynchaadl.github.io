    <h1>HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
		<pre>We present theHybridSynchAADLmodeling language andformal analysis tool for virtually synchronous cyber-physical systemswith complex control programs, continuous behaviors, and bounded clockskews, network delays, and execution times. We leverage the HybridPALS equivalence, so that it is sufficient to model and verify the simplerunderlying synchronous designs. We define theHybridSynchAADLlanguage as a sublanguage of the avionics modeling standard AADLfor modeling such designs in AADL.HybridSynchAADLmodels aregiven a formal semantics and analyzed using Maude with SMT solving,which allows us to represent advanced control programs and commu-nication features in Maude, while capturing timing uncertainties andcontinuous behaviors symbolically with SMT solving. We demonstratethe effectiveness ofHybridSynchAADLon a number of applications,including autonomous drones that collaborate to achieve common goals.</pre>
