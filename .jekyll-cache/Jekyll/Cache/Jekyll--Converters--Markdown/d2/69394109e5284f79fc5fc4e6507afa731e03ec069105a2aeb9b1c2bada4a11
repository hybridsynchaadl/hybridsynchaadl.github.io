This page explains the artifact for our paper: "HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and
Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL" by J. Lee, S. Kim, K.
Bae, and P. C. Ã–lveczky. The artifact consists of the HybridSynchAADL tool and 
scripts for the experiments. 
</p>
<p>
We provide the VM image which contains the artifact in this 
<a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699760">link</a>. A minimum resource to
run the artifact is a Quad-Core CPU with 4GB memory. In the VM, the artifact is
located in the 'home/user/CAV2021-AeC' directory. See 'Readme.txt' in the
directory for more details about the tool and experiments.

<h2>Running the artifact in a non-VM environment</h2>
<p>
We explain how to install and run the artifact in a non-VM environment.  There is required
software to run the HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments which are already
installed in the VM environment: Java1.8 and GNU parallel. To install this
software, refer to the following website:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>https://openjdk.java.net/install/ (for Java1.8)</li>
  <li>https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/ (for GNU parallel)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Download 'artifact.zip' and unzip it in your local machine. Unlike the artifact
directory in the VM image, there is the script 'set-up.sh' which automatically
installs required software in case of a specific operating system such as Ubuntu.
To run the HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments, see the 'Readme.txt' file in
the artifact directory. 
</p>

<p>
The process of running the artifact in an empty VM environment is the same as
the above process. When you have a VM environment, download the artifact from
the browser installed in the VM, or use 'Shared Folder' to move the downloaded
artifact directory into the VM from your local machine.
</p>

<h2>Setting up the HybridSynchAADL tool</h2>
<p>The script â€˜set-up.shâ€™ only sets up the environment for running the
HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments. To analyze the case study model using the
HybridSynchAADL tool, you need to follow additional steps.</p>

<p>In the artifact directory, the HybridSynchAADL tool has to create a workspace
and set Maude preferences. Double click â€˜osateâ€™ in the â€˜hybridsynchaadlâ€™
directory. In OSATE2 Launcher, choose the workspace directory wherever you want
(It is recommended to choose the default workspace direcory). There is an empty
project in the AADL Navigator window of OSATE2.</p>

<p>The HybridSynchAADL tool uses Maude-SE so that the configuration for Maude is
needed. Check whether Maude with SMT is installed on your local machine or not. When
you want to install Maude with SMT, refer to this <a href="https://maude-se.github.io">link</a>.
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking â€˜Windowâ€™ -&gt; â€˜Preferencesâ€™ in the top
menu.</p>

<p>In the preferences dialog, you can locate â€˜Maude Preferencesâ€™ category on the
left-hand side of the dialog box. In the â€˜Maude Preferencesâ€™ page, set the
installed Maude directory and executable file â€˜maude-se-yices2â€™ properly. Click
on the â€˜Apply and Closeâ€™ button to save and close the dialog box.</p>

<p>Now you can use our tool to analyze a HybridSynchAADL model. Import an existing
project in models directory such as â€˜FourDronesSystemâ€™. The process is similar
to the one used in Eclipse IDE. You can find the step-by-step process to
analyze our case study model in the â€˜User Manualâ€™ documentation.</p>
