Quad-Core CPU and 4GB memory. Download 'artifact.zip' using the browser in the
VM. You can also download 'artifact.zip' file, and then move it into the VM
using the shared folder.

<p>
Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.  There is set-up.sh
script which downloads the JDK8 and GNU parallel automatically. The script is
assumed to be executed in the Ubuntu environment so that it downloads required
software using apt (Advanced Package Tool).

website 'https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/'
</p>

<h2>Set up the HybridSynchAADL tool</h2>
<p>The script ‘set-up.sh’ sets up the environment for running the HybridSynchAADL
tool and experiments. To analyze case study model using the HybridSynchAADL
tool, you need to follow additional steps.</p>

<p>In the artifact directory, the HybridSynchAADL tool has to create a workspace
and set Maude preferences. Double click ‘osate’ in the ‘hybridsynchaadl’
