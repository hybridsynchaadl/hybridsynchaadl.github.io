This page contains the artifact for our paper: "HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and
Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL" by J. Lee, S. Kim, K.
Bae, P. C. Ölveczky, and M. Kang. The artifact consists of the HybridSynchAADL
tool, scripts for the experiments, and reachability analysis tools. 
</p>
<p>
We provide the VM image which contains the artifact in this 
<a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699760">link</a>. In the VM image, the
required software to run the tool and experiments are already installed. The
minimum resource to run the artifact is Quad-Core CPU with 4GB memory. In the
VM image, there is Readme.txt file which explains how to reproduce our results
in our paper.  The 'Readme.txt' file is located in the '/home/user/CAV2021-AeC'
directory.

<h2> Download</h2>
<p>Download ‘artifact.zip’ in this <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cpsuef5h">link</a>.</p>

<h2>Running the artifact in a non-VM environment</h2>
<p>
To run the artifact in the Ubuntu environment, you need to follow additional
steps.

Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.  There is set-up.sh
script which downloads the JDK8 and GNU parallel automatically. The script is
assumed to be executed in the Ubuntu environment so that it downloads required
software using apt (Advanced Package Tool).
</p>

<h2>How to run artifact in the non VM</h2>
<p>
Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.
To run the HybridSynchAADL tool, it needs JDK8. Refer to the
following web site: 'https://openjdk.java.net/install/'. The script
'run_expr' performs an analysis using GNU parallel. To execute the script,
download GNU parallel using your package installer or refer to the following
website 'https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/'
</p>

<h2>Set up the HybridSynchAADL tool</h2>
<p>The script ‘set-up.sh’ only sets up the environment for running the
HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments. To analyze case study model using the
HybridSynchAADL tool, you need to follow additional steps.</p>

<p>In the artifact directory, the HybridSynchAADL tool has to create a workspace
and set Maude preferences. Double click ‘osate’ in the ‘hybridsynchaadl’
directory. In OSATE2 Launcher, choose the workspace directory wherever you want
(It is recommended to choose the default workspace direcory). There is empty
project in the AADL Navigator window of OSATE2.</p>

<p>The HybridSynchAADL tool uses Maude-SE so that the configuration for Maude is
needed. Check whether Maude with SMT is installed on your local machine or not. When
you want to install Maude with SMT, refer to this <a href="https://maude-se.github.io">link</a>.
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking ‘Window’ -&gt; ‘Preferences’ in the top
menu.</p>

<p>In the preferences dialog, you can locate ‘Maude Preferences’ category on the
left hand side of the dialog box. In the ‘Maude Preferences’ page, set the
installed Maude directory and executable file ‘maude-se-yices2’ properly. Click
on the ‘Apply and Close’ button to save and close the dialog box.</p>

<p>Now you can use our tool to analyze a HybridSynchAADL model. Import an exsiting
project in models directory such as ‘FourDronesSystem’. The process is similar
to the one used in Eclipse IDE. You can find the step-by-step process to
analyze our case study model in the ‘User Manual’ documentation.</p>
