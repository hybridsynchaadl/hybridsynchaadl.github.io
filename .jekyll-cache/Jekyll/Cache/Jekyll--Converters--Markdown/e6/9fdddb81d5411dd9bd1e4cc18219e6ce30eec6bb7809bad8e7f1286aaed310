<p>This benchmark model represents the networked thermostat benchmark. Each
thermostat component communicates its own temperature to the neighboring
thermostat component and sets its power properly. The networked thermostats
eventually reach the same temperature.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-dynamics">Continuous Dynamics</h3>
<p>The continuous dynamics of the thermostat component is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="safety-property">Safety Property</h3>

<p>We verify safety invariant property which represents that temperature of each
thermostat is maintained between 20 and 50 degrees up to bound 500 ms.</p>

<p>The example of PSPC file containing safety invariant property is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>proposition [initial] : abs(env1.x - 41.2) &lt; 0.1 and
						abs(env2.x - 49.4) &lt; 0.1;
						
proposition [withinBound1] : 20.0 &lt; env1.x and env1.x &lt; 50.0;
proposition [withinBound2] : 20.0 &lt; env2.x and env2.x &lt; 50.0;


invariant [tb_500] : ?initial ==&gt; ?withinBound1 and ?withinBound2 in time 500;
</code></pre></div></div>
