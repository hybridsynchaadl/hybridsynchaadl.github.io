This page explains the artifact for our paper: "HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and
Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL" by J. Lee, S. Kim, K.
Bae, and P. C. Ölveczky. The artifact consists of the HybridSynchAADL tool and 
scripts for the experiments. 
</p>
<p>
We provide the VM image which contains the artifact in this 
<a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699760">link</a>. A minimum resource to
run the artifact is a Quad-Core CPU with 4GB memory. In the VM, the artifact is
located in the 'home/user/CAV2021-AeC' directory. See 'Readme.txt' in the
directory for more details about the tool and experiments.
</p>

<h2>Running the artifact in a non-VM environment</h2>
<p>
We explain how to install and run the artifact in a non-VM environment.
Download 'artifact.zip' in this <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cpsuef5h">link</a> 
and unzip the archive file. There is a directory 'CAV2021-AeC'. The directory
already contains the following software:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maude with SMT: https://maude-se.github.io/</li>
  <li>SpaceEx: http://spaceex.imag.fr/</li>
  <li>Flow*: https://flowstar.org/</li>
  <li>HyComp: https://es-static.fbk.eu/tools/hycomp/</li>
  <li>dReach: http://dreal.github.io/</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can also install them manually by referring to the given official website.
In addition to the above software, you have to install the following software
to run the artifact:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>JAVA8: https://openjdk.java.net/install/</li>
  <li>GNU parallel: https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is the script 'set-up.sh' which automatically installs JAVA8 and GNU
parallel for Ubuntu. When your operating system is not Ubuntu, please install them manually. After successfully setting up the artifact, see
'Readme.txt' in 'CAV2021-AeC' to run the HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments.
</p>

<p>
The above instruction can be also applied to a VM environment.

 When you have a VM environment, download the artifact from
the browser installed in the VM, or use 'Shared Folder' to move the downloaded
artifact directory into the VM from your local machine.
</p>

<h2>Setting up the HybridSynchAADL tool</h2>
<p>The script ‘set-up.sh’ only sets up the environment for running the
HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments. To analyze the case study model using the
HybridSynchAADL tool, you need to follow additional steps.</p>

<p>In the artifact directory, the HybridSynchAADL tool has to create a workspace
and set Maude preferences. Double click ‘osate’ in the ‘hybridsynchaadl’
directory. In OSATE2 Launcher, choose the workspace directory wherever you want
(It is recommended to choose the default workspace direcory). There is an empty
project in the AADL Navigator window of OSATE2.</p>

<p>The HybridSynchAADL tool uses Maude-SE so that the configuration for Maude is
needed. Check whether Maude with SMT is installed on your local machine or not. When
you want to install Maude with SMT, refer to this <a href="https://maude-se.github.io">link</a>.
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking ‘Window’ -&gt; ‘Preferences’ in the top
menu.</p>

<p>In the preferences dialog, you can locate ‘Maude Preferences’ category on the
left-hand side of the dialog box. In the ‘Maude Preferences’ page, set the
installed Maude directory and executable file ‘maude-se-yices2’ properly. Click
on the ‘Apply and Close’ button to save and close the dialog box.
