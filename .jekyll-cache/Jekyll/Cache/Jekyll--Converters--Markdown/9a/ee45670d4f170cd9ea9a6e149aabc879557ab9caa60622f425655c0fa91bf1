This page contains the artifact for our paper: "HYBRIDSYNCHAADL: Modeling and
Formal Analysis of Virtually Synchronous CPSs in AADL" by J. Lee, S. Kim, K.
Bae, P. C. Ã–lveczky, and M. Kang. The artifact consists of the HybridSynchAADL
tool, scripts for the experiments, and reachability analysis tools. We provide
the VM image which contains the artifact in this <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699760">link</a>




The artifact is same as the 'CAV2021-AeC' directory in the <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4699760">VM image</a> 
excpet for the <i>set-up.sh</i> script. Tools and scripts in the artifact runs on
Ubuntu. To run the HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments, you need to install
additional software: JDK8 and GNU parallel
</p>

<h2> Download</h2>
<p>Download â€˜artifact.zipâ€™ in this <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cpsuef5h">link</a>.</p>

<h2>How to run artifact in the empty VM</h2>
<p> 
To run artifact in the empty VM, the minimum resource of the VM is
Quad-Core CPU and 4GB memory. Download 'artifact.zip' using the browser in the
VM. You can also download 'artifact.zip' file, and then move it into the VM
using the shared folder.
</p>

<p>
Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.  There is set-up.sh
script which downloads the JDK8 and GNU parallel automatically. The script is
assumed to be executed in the Ubuntu environment so that it downloads required
software using apt (Advanced Package Tool).
</p>

<h2>How to run artifact in the non VM</h2>
<p>
Unzip the downloaded 'artifact.zip' in your home directory.
To run the HybridSynchAADL tool, it needs JDK8. Refer to the
following web site: 'https://openjdk.java.net/install/'. The script
'run_expr' performs an analysis using GNU parallel. To execute the script,
download GNU parallel using your package installer or refer to the following
website 'https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/'
</p>

<h2>Set up the HybridSynchAADL tool</h2>
<p>The script â€˜set-up.shâ€™ only sets up the environment for running the
HybridSynchAADL tool and experiments. To analyze case study model using the
HybridSynchAADL tool, you need to follow additional steps.</p>

<p>In the artifact directory, the HybridSynchAADL tool has to create a workspace
and set Maude preferences. Double click â€˜osateâ€™ in the â€˜hybridsynchaadlâ€™
directory. In OSATE2 Launcher, choose the workspace directory wherever you want
(It is recommended to choose the default workspace direcory). There is empty
project in the AADL Navigator window of OSATE2.</p>

<p>The HybridSynchAADL tool uses Maude-SE so that the configuration for Maude is
needed. Check whether Maude with SMT is installed on your local machine or not. When
you want to install Maude with SMT, refer to this <a href="https://maude-se.github.io">link</a>.
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking â€˜Windowâ€™ -&gt; â€˜Preferencesâ€™ in the top
menu.</p>

<p>In the preferences dialog, you can locate â€˜Maude Preferencesâ€™ category on the
left hand side of the dialog box. In the â€˜Maude Preferencesâ€™ page, set the
installed Maude directory and executable file â€˜maude-se-yices2â€™ properly. Click
on the â€˜Apply and Closeâ€™ button to save and close the dialog box.</p>

<p>Now you can use our tool to analyze a HybridSynchAADL model. Import an exsiting
project in models directory such as â€˜FourDronesSystemâ€™. The process is similar
to the one used in Eclipse IDE. You can find the step-by-step process to
analyze our case study model in the â€˜User Manualâ€™ documentation.</p>
