<p>This benchmark models represent the rendezvous control of distributed drones
with single-integrator dynamics. Each drone communicates its own position and
sets a proper velocity. The goal of these models is for all drones maintains a
formation during flight without any collision.</p>

<h3 id="continuous-dynamics">Continuous Dynamics</h3>
<p>The continuous dynamics of the drone component is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="safety-property">Safety Property</h3>

<p>We verify safety invariant property which represents that drones do not collide. We analyze them up to
bound 500 ms.</p>

<p>The example of PSPC file containing safety invariant property is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>proposition [initial] : abs(drone1.environment.x - 2.8) &lt; 0.1 and abs(drone1.environment.y - 2.8) and
                        abs(drone2.environment.x - 1.5) &lt; 0.1 and abs(drone2.environment.y - 1.5);

proposition [twoclose] : abs(drone1.environment.x - drone2.environment.x) &lt; 0.5 and
                         abs(drone1.environment.y - drone2.environment.y) &lt; 0.5

invariant [tb_500]: ?initial ==&gt; not(?twoclose) in time 500;
</code></pre></div></div>
